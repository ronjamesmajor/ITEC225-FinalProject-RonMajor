TODO:: 
1. Add Class Library - dump all related classes into:
	A. Library for All Request Types.
	B. Library for All Position Types.

2. Put Interfaces in Class Library.
3. Create several users and positions and candidates

4. Create some kind of container to house data (Don't use a fucking datagrid like everyone else would)
4. Set visibility on each and ensure they work.
