TODO:: 
1. Add Class Library - dump all related classes into:
	A. Library for All Request Types. >>
	B. Library for All Position Types. >>


2. Put Interfaces in Class Library. 
3. Create several users and positions and candidates

4. Create some kind of container to house data (Don't use a fucking datagrid like everyone else would)
5. Set visibility on each and ensure they work.

6. Test data stores (saving and loading users and positions and other data)
7. add toggles for user type (admin, hr, etc)
8. add toggles for save / write to or from local data or database.
9. Figure out a way to use lots of ternary operators like a boss.
